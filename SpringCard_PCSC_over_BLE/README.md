SpringCard PC/SC over BLE is the reference application to work with SpringCard smartcard and NFC/RFID readers over a Bluetooth Low Energy connection.

Use this application together with Puck Blue, or another BLE-enabled SpringCard smartcard reader. Connect to a contact or contactless smartcard, retrieve its ATR, exchange ISO 7816 APDUs; read/write NFC tags or RFID@13.56MHz labels; explore and validate your own use cases.

Once ready, clone this project and start developing your own iOS application together with SpringCard products!
